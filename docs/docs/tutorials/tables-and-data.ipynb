    "The Table component takes a pandas DataFrame and renders an HTML table in your report.&#x20;\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",

    "\n",
    "If your DataFrame includes [DataFrame Styles](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\\_guide/style.html), these will be included in your report. DataFrame styles allows you create custom formatted tables; for instance, to show trends, highlight cells, add bar charts, or display correlations.&#x20;\n",

    "## DataTable\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataTable block takes a pandas DataFrame and renders an interactive, sortable, searchable table in your report, along with advanced analysis options such as exploring data through [SandDance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sanddance/). It supports large datasets and viewers can also download the table from the website as a CSV or Excel file.\n",

    "#### **Running Queries on DataTable**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run SQL queries on your datatable if you need more advanced filtering & calculations. In the previous example, if we wanted to show only the rows which had a value A > 0.5, we would write the following (note that `$tbl` is the builtin table name and cannot be changed):  &#x20;\n",

    "## Big Number\n",
    "\n",
    "A single number or change can often be the most important thing in a report. The `BigNumber`component allows you to present KPIs, changes, and statistics in a friendly way to your viewers. You can optionally set intent, and pass in numbers or text.&#x20;\n",
